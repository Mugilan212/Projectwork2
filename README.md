## Deep Learning - Based Social Media Word-of-						Mouth Analysis Model
In the era of digital communication, social media platforms have emerged as vital channels for word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing, significantly influencing consumer behavior and brand perception. This study presents a comprehensive deep learning-based model for analyzing social media WOM, leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment and thematic insights from user-generated content.
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
We begin by outlining the importance of WOM in shaping public opinion and the challenges posed by the unstructured nature of social media data. Our approach employs a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers to capture intricate patterns and contextual meanings in textual data. The model is trained on a diverse dataset encompassing various social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, allowing for a robust analysis of sentiments—positive, negative, and neutral. We implement advanced feature extraction methods, such as TF-IDF and contextual embeddings, to enhance the model's ability to understand nuanced expressions of sentiment, including sarcasm and slang.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Focusing on sentiment classification and thematic analysis. 
- Feature Extraction To capture the semantic meaning of the text.
- The architecture of our model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction with Transformers for global context understanding. 
- Trained using a labeled dataset.
- Cross-validation to ensure robustness.
